# A² Peanut Butter 🥜✨

> Where craft meets indulgence. Built by [Prince](https://git.darkbyte.in/).

## What's This About?

Look, I got tired of peanut butter websites that felt like they were made on a template assembly line. So I built this—a premium, no-BS website for A² (A Square) Peanut Butter. It's got that liquid gold aesthetic because, let's be honest, good peanut butter deserves better than stock photos and Times New Roman.
